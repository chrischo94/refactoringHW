For this project, I refactored the Search Engine Optimization Page.
As per request of the client, I have reorganized the source code for the page.


Notable fixes;
-reorganized header and nav bar code
-streamlined the images and headers for main
-removed footer class
-removed many classes in general to streamline the code
